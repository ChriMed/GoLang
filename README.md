Programming practice with Go, basic introduction for myself to the Go programming language, learning about the different methods and practices, was a guided programming lesson from Alex Mutt at https://youtu.be/8uiZC0l4Ajw?si=PK1qX_56uSRJHTKE
This was a good way to familiarize myself with Go, and provided wth the understanding to make my own programs with Goroutines and Channels in this program.
